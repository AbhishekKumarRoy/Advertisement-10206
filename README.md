This challenge was the capstone project of Summer Analytics, a primer course on Data Science, conducted by the Consulting and Analytics Club of IIT Guwahati in the summers.

DeltaX provided the dataset is the pioneering cross-channel digital advertising platform. The cloud-based platform leverages big data, user behaviour, and machine learning algorithms to improve performance across the business funnel of advertisers.

## Problem Statement
Let's take a case where an advertiser on the platform (DeltaX) would like to estimate the performance of their campaign in the future.

Imagine it is the first day of March and you are given the past performance data of ads between 1st August to 28th Feb. You are now tasked to predict an ad's future performance (revenue) between March 1st and March 15th. Well, it is time for you to put on your problem-solving hats and start playing with the data provided under the "data" section.
